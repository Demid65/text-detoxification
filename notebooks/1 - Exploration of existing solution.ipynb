    "## Exploration of existing solutions\n",
    "Given task is an example of text2text problem, for which there are a variety of models already developed. The most straight forward solution to solve the problem is to find existing text2text model and finetune it on the provided dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring the internet, I have found a [general text2text model](https://huggingface.co/t5-small) which aims to be finetunable to different kinds of tasks. In the original [paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/volume21/20-074/20-074.pdf) Raffel et al. have tested the model on a variety of datasets and a variety of different tasks, some of which are more complicated that detoxificiation task. That means this model should be good enough for the task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is available at HuggingFace and I'll be using their set of libraries for that model. They provide a framework for translation tasks, so I'll use their [example training pipeline](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/translation.ipynb)."
